# Planned Features

* Array access syntax (`ARRAY[INDEX]`)
* User defined functions
* User defined Constants
* Some nice FOR loop variants (`FOR [ index , ] value IN list` or maybe just `FOR index IN list`)

## Maybe

* Better syntax for subroutine functions (`ARRAY#.PUSH VALUE`)?
* Maybe just make everything an expression...
* Maybe support WHILE...ELSE and FOR...ELSE, where the ELSE code runs if the loop doesn't run (but what END keyword would be used?)
