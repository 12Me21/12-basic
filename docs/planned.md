# Planned Features

* Array access syntax (`ARRAY[INDEX]`)
* User defined functions
* User defined Constants
* Some nice FOR loop variants (`FOR [ index , ] value IN list` or maybe just `FOR index IN list`)
* Structs/user defined types/tables/whatever you want to call them. Will use `@` type suffix, and literals are written as **{** *key* [ **=** *value* ] [ , ... ] **}**. `{X=1,Z=3} + {X=2,Y=1} -> {X=2,Y=1,Z=3}`
* A variable type that can store any value (type suffix `?`).

## Maybe

* Better syntax for subroutine functions (`ARRAY#.PUSH VALUE`)?
* Maybe just make everything an expression...
* Maybe support WHILE...ELSE and FOR...ELSE, where the ELSE code runs if the loop doesn't run (but what END keyword would be used?)
